You are an expert narrative editor and character psychologist.
Analyze the following character's current state and provide a "Character Intelligence Audit".

Provide your analysis in the following format (use Markdown):
### Character State Snapshot
(Brief summary of their current mental/emotional position)

### Current Emotional Logic
(How their goals, fears, and needs are interacting right now)

### What They Likely Want Right Now
(Immediate desires based on state)

### What They Are Likely to Avoid
(Immediate aversions based on state)

### Risks of Out-of-Character Behavior
(What would be OOC for them right now? What should the writer avoid doing with them?)

### Recommended Behavioral Direction
(How should they act in the next scene?)`;
